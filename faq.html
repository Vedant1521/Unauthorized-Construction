          What is this AI/ML-based construction monitoring system?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Our AI/ML-based system automatically detects and monitors
            unauthorized construction activities across the city using satellite
            imagery, drones, and ground sensors.

        <button class="faq-question">
          How does the system detect unauthorized constructions?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze images and
            data, comparing them with legal building permits and construction
            plans. Any discrepancies are flagged as potential unauthorized
            constructions.

          How frequently is the data updated?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The data is updated in real-time or at regular intervals depending
            on the data source, such as satellite passes, drone flights, or
            sensor updates.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Currently, the system is deployed in select cities, but we are
            continuously expanding our coverage. Please contact our sales team
            to learn more about availability in your area.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            We prioritize data security and privacy. All data is encrypted and
            stored in secure servers. We comply with local and international
            data protection regulations.

        <button class="faq-question">
          Can the system detect small-scale unauthorized constructions?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes, the system is designed to detect unauthorized constructions of
            all sizes, from large-scale developments to small-scale alterations.
            The precision of detection depends on the resolution of the
            satellite or drone imagery and the sensitivity of ground sensors
            used.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">
          How accurate is the detection of unauthorized constructions?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The accuracy of detection varies depending on the quality of the
            data sources used (e.g., satellite resolution, drone flight paths).
            However, our AI/ML algorithms have been trained on extensive
            datasets to maximize accuracy and minimize false positives. Regular
            updates and machine learning improvements ensure that accuracy
            continues to improve over time.

          What happens after an unauthorized construction is detected?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Once an unauthorized construction is detected, the system
            automatically generates a report and sends alerts to the relevant
            municipal authorities. These authorities can then take the necessary
            actions, such as inspections or issuing fines, to address the issue.

          How can this system help in urban planning?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            This system provides valuable data for urban planners by
            highlighting unauthorized constructions, monitoring ongoing
            development trends, and identifying areas of rapid growth. This
            information can be used to make informed decisions about
            infrastructure development, zoning regulations, and urban expansion.

          What are the costs associated with using this monitoring system?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The cost of using the system varies depending on the scale of
            monitoring required, the geographical area covered, and the
            frequency of updates. We offer flexible pricing plans tailored to
            the needs of different users, including municipal authorities,
            developers, and individual property owners.
